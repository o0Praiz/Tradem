  },
  
  // Predictive impact analysis for updates
  predictUpdateImpact: (moduleId, newVersion) => {
    const dependents = getDependentModules(moduleId);
    return analyzeBreakingChanges(dependents, newVersion);
  },
  
  // Automated rollback on integration failures
  rollbackOnFailure: (moduleId, previousVersion) => {
    if (integrationTestsFail(moduleId)) {
      revertToVersion(moduleId, previousVersion);
      notifyDevelopmentTeam(moduleId, 'ROLLBACK_EXECUTED');
    }
  }
};
```
