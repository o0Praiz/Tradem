### Quick Win Feature Implementations

#### 1. Smart Contractor Matching Algorithm
```javascript
// ai-matching-service.js - MVP implementation
const matchContractors = async (job) => {
  const factors = {
    proximity: 0.3,    // 30% weight on distance
    rating: 0.25,      // 25% weight on customer rating
    availability: 0.2, // 20% weight on immediate availability
    experience: 0.15,  // 15% weight on trade experience
    price: 0.1        // 10% weight on historical pricing
  };
  
  return calculateMatchScore(job, factors);
};
```

#### 2. Dynamic Pricing Engine
```javascript
// pricing-engine.js - Market-based pricing
const calculateOptimalPrice = (job, marketData) => {
  const basePrice = getTradeBasePrice(job.category);
  const demandMultiplier = getCurrentDemand(job.location);
  const urgencyMultiplier = getUrgencyMultiplier(job.urgency);
  
  return basePrice * demandMultiplier * urgencyMultiplier;
};
```
